What we are building: Ai Agent ( the one that do our work autonomously)

- function calling (inside agent loop)
- standard way of function calling (MCP server)
- MCP server: interact ai agent with external apps

Our phase:

- Prompt Engineering

## 7 PIllars of AI Driven Development

1. Markdown (new development language)
   - standard for giving input to AI

- all cloud is in linux (commands/ batch)

2. WSL (Windows subsystem for linux) (linux as a environment)

   - For universal code development environment

   - Github CLI

3. AI CLI

   - codex cli (openai) ($20 per month)
   - gemini cli ( best for budget : 1000 request per day free)
   - QWEN cli (2000 request per day free)
   - CLAUDE Code ($20 per month)

4. MCP server

5. Test Driven Development

   - test code test

6. Spec Driven Development

   - github spec kit (spec kit plus by sir zia)
   - everything step by step

7. Deployment

   - cluster ( when in claude use multiple computers at the same point)
   - digital ocean (for small companies)
   - Azure (for big companies) (hyper scaler)

   - Docker (image) (partition of linux)
   - kubernetes
   - dapper (which microservice communciate with wich microservice service)
   - Ray (hardware resources sharing)
